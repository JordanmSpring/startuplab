Hi <%= @user.name -%>,

Unfortunately your paid "<%= @plan_name -%>" plan has expired. You have been downgraded automatically to the "<%= Plan::Free.name -%>" plan.

<%- if @ideas.present? -%>
None of your data has been removed, but these canvases have been made private:

<%- @ideas.each do |idea| -%>
<%= "* #{idea.name} (#{angular_idea_url(idea)})" %>
<% end -%>

You can upgrade your account at any time to make them public again.
<%- else -%>
None of your data has been removed.
<%- end -%>

Feel free to reply to this mail if you have any questions, or would like assistance upgrading your account.
